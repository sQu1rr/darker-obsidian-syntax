# Darker Obsidian Theme

A fork of Obsidian Theme that tries to match the colours of Obsidian theme for
VIM (which is a port of KDEs obsidian coast theme:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3140

The goal is not to completely replicate VIMs theme, but to create a theme that
is comfortable to use for myself, so some improvements will be made here and
there

# Obsidian Theme for Atom (Original)

A port of Notepad++'s obsidian theme to Atom. Only tested on PHP, matches
closely at the moment, I may make some changes in the future however.
